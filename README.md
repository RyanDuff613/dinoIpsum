# API Practice Using Data Retrieved from Dino Ipsum

#### Epicodus Week 6 | Intermediate JavaScript: Asynchrony and API's

#### By Ryan Duff

## Description
This is a demonstration of skills learned in week 6 of the Epicodus Ruby/React curriculum. It uses Node Package Manager and Webpack to handle user and development dependencies. Jest is employed to run tests on the Javascript code. Babel is used to refactor the Javascript, which contains elements of ES6, into an earlier version of the language which is more readable by older browsers. The Javascript code collects data from Dino Ipsum public API and displays the data for the user.
